# web-dev-learning-path
> An opinionated guide to learning web development.

This is my attempt to create a learning path for those interested in web development - whether you're a total beginner, or you just want to improve your skills. There's so much information available online nowadays that it's easy to get lost in the middle of it all without knowing where to begin.

The *opinionated* in the description of the repo is to show that this is just the way I see that it could be done, but it might be different for everyone, so feel free to adapt accordingly.

I'm under the impression that lately, especially given the rise of popular JavaScript frameworks, many people might be skipping the traditional HTML and CSS basics - and even the basic understanding of how a website actually works - and jumping straight to some framework or library. That might work for some people (and be sure to jump to that if that's what you're looking for) but I do believe a solid knowledge on the basis of web development might be beneficial to your web dev skills, so I added material on those basic stuff as well.

This is a draft for now, and I hope to add more material and improve it soon. I also hope to write some articles soon about some of these topics, and will link them here whenever they're available.

## Here is how I would structure the learning path:

1. Basic programming
    * it would be good to have some basic algorithms and data structures background knowledge
    * some of these things might work better and more easily on UNIX systems, so if you're running in Windows, maybe it would be nice to get a Linux dist installed
    * having a good development environment is good. Basic text editors, as Sublime and Atom are very popular for web dev. There are some plugins that help you customize them for the specific languages that you're developing in. I would recommend looking up some tips for that (e.g. Google something like "Sublime set up for JavaScript development")
    * I believe having good programming practices is very beneficial, and would recommend this book: Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship, by Robert C. Martin
    * having some understanding of good software development project management might help. I would recommend getting to know Agile and Scrum concepts
        * https://www.scrum.as/academy.php
        * software that might help:
            * Jira
            * Trello

8. Back end

9. infrastructure
    * what is devops
    * main tools

10. Where to go from here:
